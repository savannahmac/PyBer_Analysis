# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
- The ride sharing company, PyBer, would like to appropriately allocate its resources in order to increase profits across a range of city types.
- Our analysis was focused around the following data:
	- Total Rides in each city type
	- Total Drivers in each city type
	- Total Fares earned in each city type
	- Average Fare Per Ride in each city type
	- Average Fare Per Driver in each city type
- After creating a streamlined data frame with this information, our ultimate goal was to visualize the total fares earned in each city type in the following date range:
	- January 1, 2019 - April 29, 2019

## Results: 
- Below you will see the summary data frame created from PyBer's 2019 ride and city data.

- The data frame highlights these facts
	- Urban cities host 13 times as many rides as rural cities and nearly 3 times as many rides as suburban cities.
	- Urban cities had over 30 times as many drivers as rural cities and nearly 5 times as many drivers as suburban cities.
	- Although the service appears to be less popular in rural cities, the average fare per ride is $10 more in rural areas than urban areas. 
	- Drivers in rural areas are earning significantly more per ride in rural cities than in urban cities. 

- Below you will see a line chart depicting the Total Fare by city type.
- Dips and peaks depicted in the chart show weekly changes.

- This chart highlights these facts
	- Urban cities are contributing the most to PyBer revenue. 
	- Rural cities are currently contributing the least to PyBer revenue.
	- Even though suburban and rural cities contribute lower total fares, their fares are more consistent week to week. 
	
## Summary
- Based on this data, I would recommend the following next steps: 
	1. It's time to push for more drivers in rural areas! 
		- Rural areas have less drivers, but their average fares are much higher than in cities or suburban areas.
		- We might assume that these fares are much higher because rural customers will have longer distances to travel.
		- If more drivers are available, present, and spreading the word about riding and driving with PyBer, the number of rides might also increase.
		- Offering incentives for new drivers in these areas could get more drivers on board.

	2. Suburban customers have more consistent habits. Invest in them!
		- Suburban customers ride more consistently than urban customers.
		- Throughout the months of January - April, suburban fares stayed fairly consistent week to week.
		- Marketing PyBer to suburban communities could increase profits in a very consistent demographic.
		- Possibly use a 'PyBer to Work This Week' Campaign to influence suburban customers to get started using PyBer
	
	3. Slow driver recruitment in urban areas.
		- There is an excess of drivers in urban areas. 
		- This allows riders to have available drivers at all times. However, this also means that drivers might spread the word that PyBer is not a great way to make money.
		- PyBer needs invested, committed, and motivated drivers.
		- Slowing driver recruitment in urban areas could allow the number of drivers to balance out, allow individual drivers to make better money per ride.
